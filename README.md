This project is a fork of official [PHP SDK v1.7](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-php) for [Sentry](https://getsentry.com) to work even with php5.2.

## Features

- Automatically report (un)handled exceptions and errors
- Send customized diagnostic data
- Process and sanitize data before sending it over the network

## Installation

There are various ways to install the PHP integration for Sentry.  The
recommended way is to use [Composer](http://getcomposer.org).

    $ composer require immobiliare/sentry-php:1.7.x-dev

Alternatively you can manually install it:

1.  Download and extract the latest [sentry-php](https://github.com/immobiliare/sentry-php/archive/master.zip>) archive to your PHP project.
2.  Require the autoloader in your application:

```php
require_once '/path/to/Raven/library/Raven/Autoloader.php';
Raven_Autoloader::register();
```

## Usage

```php
// Instantiate a new client with a compatible DSN and install built-in
// handlers
$sentryClient = new Raven_Client('https://e9ebbd88548a441288393c457ec90441:399aaee02d454e2ca91351f29bdc3a07@app.getsentry.com/3235');
$sentryClient->install();

// Capture an exception
$event_id = $sentryClient->captureException($ex);

// Give the user feedback
echo "Sorry, there was an error!";
echo "Your reference ID is " . $event_id;
```
